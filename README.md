# FutureFlow
FutureFlow is a SwiftUI-based iOS library that enables you to create engaging and informative tutorials within your app. With customizable "spotlight" tutorials, you can guide users through the key features of your app seamlessly. FutureFlow is easy to integrate and includes detailed documentation and sample code to help you get started.

## Compatibility
This is a light weight SwiftUI ONLY package. It works with `iOS 14.0+`, `macOS 11.0+`, `tvOS 14.0+`, `watchOS 7.0+`.

As of **April 22nd, 2023**, there are no plans to support UIKit nor support any SwiftUI backward compatibility (e.g. `iOS 
13.0`).

If you however, would like to tackle backward compatibility or UIKit support, feel free to fork this repo and work on it and 
hit me up to merge your contribution and credit you.
